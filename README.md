# Altium Designer Project

This project is regarding the “Nixie Bargraph Thermometer”. This device can measure the degrees with an IN-9 indicator tube.  The thermometer contains RGB lights which lets the design stand out. It is a project which is challenging due to the issues which occur during the assembly.

# Material and methods

## Software

As you can see in the following picture, this device provides an arduino nano to control the PCB.

## IN-9 Tube

The thermometer contains a complete Arduino Nano computer that reads the temperature sensor and the PWM signal for controlling the IN-9 Tube

## Resistors

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. This project contains  22 resistors  to limit and regulate the flow of electrical current in this electronic circuit to overcome overheating.

## capacitors

This design needs capacitors to store electric charge in electric fields. In this project the capacitors add capacitance to the circuit. Capacitance is the ratio of the amount of electric charge stored on a conductor to a difference in electric potential.
